Well, for starters, this is my first assignment for the 'Web Development 101' from The Odin Project.

I'll do my best do make a "perfect" copy of Google's home page. 

Then, I'll also make Google's results page. Although that seems a bit harder, it's a good challenge to take.

As a 'side note' I'll make this with pure CSS and I won't use any CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
